Moved from SKILL.md. Read when tuning performance, error recovery, model fallbacks, observability or output formats.

### 6. Performance Optimisation

- Cache Portfolio Registry context across invocations.
- Batch similar tool calls when possible.
- Use adaptive depth: low stakes = fast path; high stakes = full depth.
- Prompt caching: reuse stable context blocks.

### 7. Error Recovery & Resilience

- Missing evidence → retry once, then flag gap.
- Tool timeout → log and use fallback.
- Context overflow → compress, preserving evidence.
- 3 consecutive failures → circuit breaker; handoff to /tao-loop.

### 8. Cross-Model Fallbacks

| Use case | Primary | Fallback |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Routine | Sonnet/Haiku | Default |
| Complex analysis | Sonnet | DeepSeek/Claude-4 |
| Board-facing | Opus | Boardroom MOA |
| Fast inline | Haiku | Sonnet |

### 9. Observability

Metrics emitted per invocation: duration, tools used, tokens consumed, self-review score, success/failure, evidence count, file count, improvement queued.
Session summary: aggregate metrics, common failure patterns, recommended skill patches.

### 10. Multi-Modal & Cross-Format

- Ingest images, diagrams, mockups via vision toolset.
- Output as markdown (default), JSON (structured), DOCX/PPTX (external), or Slack blocks.
- Cross-format negotiation based on `output_target` parameter.
